        answer:
          "Denver, CO investors can identify up to three replacement properties without value limits, or identify more than three properties if the total value does not exceed two hundred percent of the relinquished property value, or identify unlimited properties if the total value of properties actually acquired equals at least ninety five percent of the total identified value.
